# Config files

Stash of the config files I use

## vimrc

Customzied config for VIM, that includes a theme and quite a few tweaks. Most of the optimization is done to make programming easier.
Highly recommend reading this, not just for Python but general VIM enhancements: [VIM and Python â€“ A Match Made in Heaven](https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/#nix-linux)

## tmux.conf

Tmux config! Some changes to make life easier - major one being changing 'Ctrl+B' to 'Ctrl+A', and adding vim bindings.

## zshrc
 
ZSH config file
